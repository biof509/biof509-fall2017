Asking for Help
===============

We will not be running regular office hours during the course. We are available by email to provide support and can schedule to meet on an ad hoc basis as needed.

* Jonathan Street (jonathan.street@nih.gov)
* Alexander Goncearenco (alexandr.goncearenco@nih.gov)

Email is the fastest way we can help anyone needing support but it is not instant. If we need to get additional information there will be additional delays each time we go back and forth. These delays can quickly add up.

Provide detail
    Tell us what you were expecting and what you actually get.

Include code
    If you have a problem with a piece of code then send us the code. There is little we can do with an email stating, "It doesn't work" with no other information. 
    
Check that the notebook is working correctly
    Jupyter notebook generally works very well but can occasionally break. If you are having an issue with code running in a notebook a useful first step is restarting the kernel.
    
Check that the issue is reproducible
    We can often spot issues without needing to actually run the code. For more subtle issues some debugging is needed. If you are loading data from a file please send the file and correct any paths in the notebook. Cells in a notebook can be run in any order and variables persist even if the cell that created them is altered. To ensure we will see the same issue you are seeing restart the kernel and then run each cell in sequence.
    
    
Restarting the kernel
