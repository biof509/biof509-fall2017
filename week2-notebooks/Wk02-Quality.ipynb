    "\n",
    "To help with adhering to the guide there are a number of software tools that can automatically check our code. [flake8](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flake8) is one example that checks against the style guide as well as catching some other issues."

    "\n",
    "We have now moved our solver out to its own file, corrected a styling issue, and added documentation. For each change a new file was created and if we continue like this we will lose track of which is the most current version. This is a contrived example but is a real issue. Each time we try a new approach to a problem it is tempting to create a new file in case the original proves superior.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a small project this might be just about bearable. As a project grows and requires multiple different files it becomes nearly impossible to manually keep track of the dependencies. This is a very old problem, and there are a number of highly developed software tools to keep track of different file versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of creating new files whenever any change is tried, the current version is committed to the version control software and changes can then be made directly. If the change is an improvement it can also be committed to the version control software, if not then the changes can be deleted and the original restored.\n",
